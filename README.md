## Overview
<p>This repository contains code samples, datasets, and documentation covering foundational algorithms and practical implementations in machine learning. It is intended for beginners, students, and professionals who want a quick reference or starting point for ML projects.</p>

## What is Machine Learning?
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. ML systems identify patterns in data, make predictions, and automate decision-making for a variety of tasks.

Types of Machine Learning
Supervised Learning: The model is trained on labeled data (input, output pairs). Examples: Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Neural Networks.

Unsupervised Learning: The model finds structure in unlabeled data. Examples: K-Means Clustering, PCA, Association Rules.

Semi-supervised Learning: Uses both labeled and unlabeled data for training.

Reinforcement Learning: The model learns to make a sequence of decisions by receiving rewards or penalties.

Common Algorithms
Linear Regression

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forests

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

K-Means Clustering

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Neural Networks

Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
